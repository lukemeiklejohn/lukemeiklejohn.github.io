                <div class="col-md-6 text"><br>A breath inwards to restore and fill one's lungs, and then, a crescendo. From stillness and quietude, arpeggios climb until they meet their mighty peaks - and leave the listener reinvigorated and the orchestra triumphant.
                <br><br>
                Tasting the new Taaibosch Crescendo provides much the same experience – no doubt for listener and orchestra alike. From the property and name of the Cordoba icon of years gone by, last produced in 2004, this rebirth couldn’t be more aptly titled.
                <br><br>
                65% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot, and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon make up this WO Stellenbosch which aims to be a true reflection of its origins and to pay homage to its rich legacy.
                <br><br>
                The wine itself is plush, with aniseed, cedar, and coriander seed aromatics adding to the dark depth of cassis and blackberry. So young, it does take a while to open up – adding to the (metaphorical, and literal) tension of the crescendo, and even as it does, with strong, yet fine, tannins. On the palate, it is a true Stellenbosch Bordeaux-style; richness and depth of fruit balanced by elegance and a finish that is long and savoury. This is a wine for the collection that will reward for years to come.

                  <div class="col-md-6 text"><br>Kleine Zalze's Project Z range was launched in late 2020 to much acclaim - just prior to release the estate had been named Platter's Top Performing Winery of the Year with seven wines being awarded 5 Stars by the Guide, three of which came from this elusive and experimental range made up of six wines with tiny production quantities mostly around 500 bottles.
                  <br><br>
                  The range emerged as an eclectic project where winemakers were free to experiment with creative winemaking techniques such as skin contact and the use of amphorae. That creativity comes through at a mere glance at the labels - this one designed by winemaker RJ Botha under the guidance of accomplished linocut artist Theo Paul Vorster.
                  <br><br>
                  As for the wine itself, it reminds me of why I love Grenache so much. With cinnamon and sweet red berries typical of the light-skinned grape on the front of the palate, the wine has a delicateness no doubt from minimalistic winemaking, the juice seeing 12 months in a 500L amphora and no oak.
                  <br><br>
                  As it develops on one's palate, this wine from 1981 Darling bush vines begins to sing, with a smokiness and herbaceous elements developing. Whilst quite tight on initial opening, after 24 hours the nose was leaping out of my glass even at fridge temperature, proving that the 'Angela Lloyd test' has true merit and will allow the best wines to sing even more melodiously. I love the freshness, acidity, and purity of fruit that is backed by super fine tannins and a mushroomy forest floor finish.
